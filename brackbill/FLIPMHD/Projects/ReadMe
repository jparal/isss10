     To run the problem for which input gives the data, type:

    time ../Sources/./xflip

     The path to libgomp may not be correct on your system.  If you don't have it
     remove -fopenmp from the command line, and the program will run serially.


     The execution will produce the files *.dx, which are data files for OpenDX
     in native format.  It also writes fort.20, with a time series of values of energy,
     which can be plotted using gnuplot and ../Plotters/plotNRG.

    The problem is a 3D Kelving Helmholtz instability. A Harris sheet with B-y
    reversing sign at z=L_z/2 is driven unstable by a shear flow u_x, which also reverses sign at 
    z=L_z/2.  The novelty is that the shear flow varies in strength along the magnetic field,
    so that the instability develops less rapidly at z=L_z/4 (B10.8.tiff) than at z=L_z/2
    (B10.16.tiff).  In contrast with the same instability with no variation in y where
    no magnetic reconnection occurs, there is reconnection with variation.  This is evident in 
    FieldLines10.tiff and FieldLines20.tiff, or it would be with x-ray vision. 

    The calculation with a 32x32x32 mesh requires 20 minutes.  One with a 16x16x16 mesh requires
    less than 2 minutes.  the results are similar for resolved modes.

    OpenDX plotting files are in Plotters.  With graphical interface, set import path to 
    ../Projects/**.dx, depending o which file you wish to plot.
