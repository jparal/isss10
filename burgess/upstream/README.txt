Beam instability at oblique angle, as expected upstream
of e.g. the Earth's bow shock.

Waves grow to large, shocklet-like amplitudes.  Short-wavelength
whistlers ensue upstream.

Here, temperature diagnostic treats both species equally (i.e., in 
center-of-mass frame) - but each species is collected in properly
indexed temperatures.  

Note that input "vxspec" is really parallel velocity, not along "x".
