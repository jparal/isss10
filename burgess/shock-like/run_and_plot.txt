Instructions
============


(When using Microsoft Windows, first open a DOS window via 
start/all programs/accessories/Command Prompt.  
Gnuplot under windows is typically called wgnuplot.  Run wgnuplot 
from an existing desktop shortcut, or create such a shortcut, 
or run it from the installation directory)



1. use gfortran to compile:
---------------------------

- in a command prompt/console window,
  change directory to folder containing source code using
  cd [directory_name] until you arrive at the destination
  you can also move up with the command: cd .. 
  you can determine the current directory with: pwd

- compile the source code with:

  gfortran -O2 1d_hybrid.F -o hyb.exe

  ...which will provide the executable hyb.exe

*** Note for other compilers: you may have to change the
*** random number generator call - see last 12 lines of
*** source code for example how to do this. 



2. run from the command prompt:
-------------------------------

- use "cp" to copy one of the input files into a file called "input.txt"

- run hyb.exe from the command prompt ("./hyb.exe" under Linux or Unix)



3. use gnuplot to plot one of the data files:
---------------------------------------------

- change directories within gnuplot:

  you may be able to use the "file --> Change Directory" feature to do this

  note that you may not be able to use "wild cards"
  note that you need to include all expressions in quotes
  example: 

     pwd
     cd "../.."  (to move up two levels)
     cd "Documents and Settings" (windows example)
     cd "ISSS-9_DKV" or similar

- for most plotting, enable 2-D images by typing:

     set style data image

- then plot any of the produced ASCII data files:

  plot "by.dat"
